## Why This List?

Agentic AI systems — LLM-powered agents that autonomously use tools, access data, and coordinate with other agents — introduce an entirely new class of security risks beyond traditional LLM vulnerabilities. This curated list organizes resources along the **"Attack Surface → Hardening Techniques → Evaluation & Testing → Governance & Standards"** pipeline, so whether you approach from a red team or blue team perspective, you can quickly find what you need.

The taxonomy aligns with three authoritative sources:

| Source | Coverage |
